Vdd2 is the supply voltage for the input buffers and core logic of a memory chip

Higher values might improve stabilty on higher memory freqs

Erista Default: 1125mV
Mariko Default: 1100mV
Official lpddr4(x) range: 1060mV~1175mV (1100mV nominal)

OCS need high voltage unlike l4t because of not scaling mtc table well, however it is recommended to stay within official limits
