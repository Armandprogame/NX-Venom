The EMC DVB Shift is responsible for managing memory voltage offsets, with a significant impact on power consumption, especially on the memory controller

SoC voltage automatically gets raised with higher dram clock

Each shift number raises 25mV more, up to max SoC voltage

Helps with stability at higher memory clock
